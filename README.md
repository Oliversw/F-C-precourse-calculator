Calculator made in pure JavaScript, modelled after the standard MacOS calculator.

## Getting Started

Visit [this link](https://oliversw.github.io/FAC-precourse-calculator/) to view and use the calculator.

## Bugs and Issues
- currently follows Immediate Execution logic, but the goal was to follow Formula/Expression logic
- When display reads 0 and decimal point is pressed, the leading 0 is not kept
- Multiple decimal points can be added
- AC does not always clear all as it should - needs testing

## Future Improvements
- Refactor code to properly follow Formula/Expression Logic
- Add keyboard interaction for buttons
